# FGCU SE/CS Chatbot

A web-based chatbot application that serves as a personal academic advisor for students in the FGCU Software Engineering (SE) and Computer Science (CS) programs. The application provides answers to academic-related questions via a chatbot powered by a backend API.

## Features

- Chat with the FGCU chatbot, which provides academic advice.
- Displays messages in a conversational format, with user and AI messages differentiated.
- Easy-to-use interface with a chat popup that expands into a full-screen chat view.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
